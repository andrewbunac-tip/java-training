##  Bank Transaction (OOP)
1. Suppose you are developing a program that models a set of bank accounts. Each account has different types of transactions, such as deposits, withdrawals, and transfers, and different account types, such as checking, savings, or credit. You need to design a class hierarchy that allows the program to manage each type of account and perform computations based on the specific transaction types and account types.
2. For example, you could have a base class called "Account" with subclasses for "CheckingAccount", "SavingsAccount", and "CreditAccount". Each subclass could have unique properties and methods that reflect its specific characteristics, such as the interest rate or minimum balance for a savings account. You could also have a superclass called "Transaction" with subclasses for "Deposit", "Withdrawal", and "Transfer". Each transaction subclass could have methods for updating the account balance and checking for overdrafts or other errors.
3. You could use inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism to ensure that the account and transaction objects can be used interchangeably and that the program can perform computations and generate reports based on the specific account and transaction types. For example, you could calculate interest earnings for savings accounts or generate statements for credit accounts.
4. Don't Forget to create Main Class to Test you  Code
