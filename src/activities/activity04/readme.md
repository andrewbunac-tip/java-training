Interface Activity


1. Create an Interface named Math.java
2. create abstract method inside your Math.java interface, the name of the method must be "compute()" ( double  Compute());
3. The compute abstract method must have return type double
4. The method must accept no parameters.
5. Create the below Classes:
   * Addition.java 
   * Subscription.java 
   * Multiplication.java 
   * Division.java
6. Each class must have attributes. Depending on what mathematical operation. add more attributes if necessary.
7. Attributes must be private
8. Class must have a constructor accepting parameters for attributes.
9. No need to create Assessors and mutators since we care only about the result of operations.
10. Implement the Math.java in each Class. depending on what Class it is, implement the mathematical operation on it.
    * For example, if it,s Addition.java, implement the double compute() method and place your codes that add two numbers(add the value of two attributes).
    Create a main class  that will test the Interface, test each created class
    
**Additional:**
11. Each of you, create two more class that needs computations(eg. SquareArea.java, Volume.java, Power.Java, Speed.java)
12. Implement the Math.java to your new Class.
13. Test it inside Main.java
