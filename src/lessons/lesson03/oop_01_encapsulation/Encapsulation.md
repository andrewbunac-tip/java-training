Encapsulation

* refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data, or the restricting of direct access to some of an object's components.

* Encapsulation is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class, preventing direct access to them by clients in a way that could expose hidden implementation details or violate state invariance maintained by the methods.

* Real world example: Say you’re the owner of the bank, how do you secure your ATM machines from customers depositing fake money? You’ll put devices that scans for real money features and rejects the ones that’s did not pass the scan..
