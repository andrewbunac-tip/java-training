Abstraction
* is the process of hiding the internal details of an application from the outer world.

* Abstraction is used to describe things in simple terms.

* Itâ€™s used to create a boundary between the application and the client programs.

* Real world example: You know how each button in the remote controller works (e.g. changing channel), but you have no idea of the complex circuitry that enables it to change channel.
