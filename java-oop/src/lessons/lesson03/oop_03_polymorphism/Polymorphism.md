Polymorphism

* “Having many forms”. Subclasses of a class can define their own unique behaviors and yet share some of the same functionality of the parent class.

* Real world example: Try right-clicking on your desktop and on a file. Notice that their context menus are different. Yet, you clicked the same button on your mouse.
